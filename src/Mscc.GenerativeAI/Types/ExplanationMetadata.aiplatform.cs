AutoML tabular Models always have this field populated by Vertex AI. Note: The URI given on output may be different, including the URI scheme, than the one given on input.

It describes a text feature which has the name specified as the key in ExplanationMetadata.inputs. The baseline of the empty feature is chosen by Vertex AI. For Vertex AI-provided Tensorflow images, the key can be any friendly name of the feature. Once specified, featureAttributions are keyed by this key (if not grouped with another feature). For custom images, the key must match with the key in instance.
