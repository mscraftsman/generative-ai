### Plan
- [ ] Investigate the `functioncall` branch and the current implementation of `GeminiChatClient`.
- [ ] Analyze the differences in function calling between the OpenAI and Gemini APIs.
- [ ] Implement the necessary changes in `Mscc.GenerativeAI.Microsoft/GeminiChatClient.cs` to support function calling.
- [ ] Create a new sample application in the `samples` folder to demonstrate and test function calling with `GeminiChatClient`.
- [ ] Create a pull request with the fix.
- [ ] Notify the users in the issue about the fix.
